# Development Principles

This document provides essential development principles for the Robota project.

## Project Overview

The Robota SDK is designed as a modular system for AI conversation management with support for multiple providers, tools, and plugins.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Modularity and Separation

- Each feature should be implemented as clearly separated modules
- Dependencies between modules should be minimized and explicitly managed
- Core modules should not depend on specific implementations
- Each @robota-sdk package should be independently usable

### Interface-First Design

- Clear interface definitions with comprehensive TypeScript types
- Design considering extensibility and backward compatibility
- Consistent naming conventions across all packages
- Define interfaces before implementations

### Error Handling Strategy

- Use typed errors with clear error codes and messages
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures  
- Provide meaningful error context for debugging
- Log errors at appropriate levels with structured data

## Development Philosophy

### Pragmatic Approach

- Prioritize working solutions over perfect abstractions
- Balance code quality with development velocity
- Make decisions based on user impact and maintainability
- Embrace iterative improvement over big-bang changes

### User-Centric Design

- Design APIs from the user's perspective
- Provide clear error messages and helpful debugging information
- Support common use cases with minimal configuration
- Offer advanced configuration for power users

### Maintainability Focus

- Write code that is easy to understand and modify
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Plan for deprecation and migration paths

## Development Workflow Principles

### Incremental Development

- Break large features into smaller, reviewable changes
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring
- Use feature flags for experimental functionality
- Deploy changes incrementally with monitoring

### Quality Assurance

- Write tests for all public APIs and critical paths
- Use automated tools for code quality checks
- Perform thorough code reviews
- Monitor production metrics and user feedback

### Documentation-Driven Development

- Write documentation before implementing major features
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Provide examples for common use cases
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
