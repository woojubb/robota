Cost-limited DAG runs now reserve credits for each leased task attempt before execution. Successful output settlement converts the hold to a charge; failure, cancellation, and reclaim release it. Stored cumulative totals from successful legacy tasks remain the accounting floor when individual estimates are absent.

Custom executors used with `createDagFramework` or `WorkerLoopService` must implement `estimateCost(input)` for cost-limited runs. It must return a finite, nonnegative estimate before `execute` starts; a missing or invalid estimate fails the task. Direct `commitExecution` callers must reserve credits before settling a successful task in a cost-limited run.

Direct `createExecutionComposition` callers that wrap a `LifecycleTaskExecutorPort` must pass `lifecycleCreditAdmission: true` in the composition dependencies so the worker recognizes that the wrapped lifecycle reserves credits before execution.
