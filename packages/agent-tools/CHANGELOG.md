# @robota-sdk/agent-tools

## 3.0.0-beta.81

### Minor Changes

- 3038eb7: A message from another session is instant messaging: text from an untrusted third party that
  carries no authority. What the model does with it is decided by the session's ordinary permissions —
  rules, permission mode and remembered consent — exactly like the session's own work. The per-origin
  peer policy is gone.

  **BREAKING**

  - `agent-core`: `IPermissionEvaluationContext.peerTurn` is now a boolean. It decides only whether a
    `repliesToPeer` tool exists; every other call in a peer turn is decided as in any turn. Removed:
    `isToolAvailableInPeerTurn`, `isSecretPath`, `IPeerTurnAuthority`, `TPeerReach` (now exported by
    `agent-interface-session-mobility`) and `IToolPermissionProfile.workspacePaths`.
  - `agent-tools`: `Read` and `Glob` no longer declare `workspacePaths`.
  - `agent-session`: `ISessionRunOptions.peerReach` is replaced by `peerTurn?: boolean`, and
    `ISessionOptions.allowPeerChanges` is removed. An ask in a peer turn is answered like any other:
    a consent the operator remembered answers it, and an "always allow" given there is remembered.
  - `agent-interface-session`: `IPeerTurnContext` no longer has `reach`; it carries only the reply
    route.
  - `agent-interface-session-mobility`: `peerReachOf` is removed; `TPeerReach` moves here. A delegated
    turn carries no reach.
  - `agent-framework`: the `peers.allowChanges` setting is removed (an existing value is ignored). A
    peer turn is offered the ordinary tools, plus `peer_reply`.

  **Changes**

  - `agent-framework`: the per-turn statement tells the model the message is an opinion from an
    untrusted third party, not its owner's instruction, and that it decides for itself whether and how
    to act. A message still expands no `@path` and attaches no context reference, and its requests
    still carry no provider-hosted tool, since no permission step can decide one. The session takes
    at most 6 messages a minute and 30 an hour from each sender for a turn; a message over the limit
    is refused with a reason the sender receives. A prompt answer given in the name of a `peer:` or `external:`
    driver is ignored. External-event turns keep their tool-less baseline.
  - `agent-cli`: incoming peer turns carry only their reply route.

## 3.0.0-beta.80

### Major Changes

- 807d161: **BREAKING — ARCH-010: the execution root is a required contract field, and the containment guard now fails closed.**

  The file-tool containment guard was fail-open: with no root configured it answered "allowed". A tool
  built with no `cwd` therefore had no boundary — measured, a `Read` constructed that way returned the
  contents of `/etc/hostname` — and the child-process subagent worker called `createDefaultTools()` with
  no argument at all, so subagents got exactly that. Three independent auditors found three different
  symptoms of this one missing field.

  **Removed — seven context-free tool singletons.** `readTool`, `writeTool`, `editTool`, `globTool`,
  `grepTool`, `shellTool`, `bashTool` are gone from `@robota-sdk/agent-tools`. A module-level instance is
  bound at import time and can carry no containment root, so after the guard was inverted they could only
  refuse everything.

  Migrate to the factory of the same name, passing the directory the tool is allowed to work in:

  ```ts
  // before
  import { readTool, globTool } from '@robota-sdk/agent-tools';
  const tools = [readTool, globTool];

  // after
  import { createReadTool, createGlobTool } from '@robota-sdk/agent-tools';
  const cwd = process.cwd(); // or the workspace this agent is scoped to
  const tools = [createReadTool({ cwd }), createGlobTool({ cwd })];
  ```

  `webFetchTool`, `webSearchTool` and `askUserQuestionTool` are unchanged — they touch no filesystem, so
  there is no root to contain them by.

  **`cwd` is now REQUIRED** on `ISandboxToolOptions`, `IContainedBuiltinToolOptions` (and everything
  extending them), `ICreateDefaultToolsOptions`, `ISessionOptions` and `ISubagentOptions`. The `= {}`
  default parameter was removed from every builtin factory — that default was the mechanism by which
  "forgot the root" was legal. `new Session({...})` without `cwd` no longer compiles, and also throws at
  construction, because a required field is only required to a TypeScript caller.

  **`Session` no longer reads `process.cwd()`.** It uses the root it was given, and `getCwd()` exposes it
  so a fork or subagent asks the session instead of re-deriving a root that can disagree with it.

  **Behavioural change even for callers that already passed a root**: a tool that somehow reaches the
  guard with no root now REFUSES with an explicit error ("no containment root is configured … this is an
  assembly bug, not a path problem") instead of allowing the access.

### Minor Changes

- 267af5f: The execution containment seam states where tools run.

  - **`ISandboxClient.filesystem`** (`'shared' | 'separate'`, absent means `separate`).
    - With a **separate** filesystem (E2B, in-memory), every file tool goes through the sandbox, and
      `Glob`/`Grep`, which can only read the host, are withheld. Previously a remote sandbox still
      offered host-reading search tools beside sandbox-writing edit tools.
    - With a **shared** filesystem (OS-level confinement over the host's files), file tools stay on
      the host under the path guard, and only commands go through the sandbox.
  - **`describeExecutionContainment` / `routesFilesThroughSandbox`** name the containment (`host`,
    `sandbox-shared`, `sandbox-separate`) instead of inferring it from an absent value.
  - **`robota doctor` reports `execution.containment`.** Robota composes no sandbox today, so the
    doctor says shell commands run unconfined on the host and the permission rules are the only
    boundary. The CLI composition and the doctor read the same value.
  - **The `Agent` and `BackgroundProcess` tools no longer fall back to `process.cwd()`** when they
    were built without an execution root. They report an assembly error instead, as the file tools
    already did (ARCH-010).

- 722e88a: Shell commands can run in an OS-level sandbox: bubblewrap on Linux and WSL2, Seatbelt on macOS.

  - **Confinement:** covers the command and every process it starts.
    - Writes are limited to the working directory, the temporary directories and
      `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`.
    - Agent, git-hook, MCP and shell configuration inside the workspace stays read-only.
    - `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` hides paths from the command.
    - The network is on or off (`sandbox.network.enabled`).
  - **Modes:** `/sandbox` switches between `auto-allow`, `regular` and `off` for the next command and
    saves the choice.
    - In `auto-allow` (`sandbox.autoAllowBashIfSandboxed`), a confined command runs without a prompt
      in `default` and `acceptEdits`.
    - Deny rules, ask rules, critical removals and plan mode still apply first.
  - **Exclusions:** `sandbox.excludedCommands` run unconfined, through the ordinary permission path.
  - **When the sandbox cannot run:** a missing or unusable backend is reported at startup, in
    `robota doctor` and in `/sandbox`, and commands then run unconfined.
    `sandbox.failIfUnavailable` refuses to start instead.
  - **New contracts:**
    - `OsSandboxClient`, `detectOsSandbox`, `bubblewrapArguments`, `seatbeltProfile`.
    - `ISandboxClient.wrapCommand` and `autoApproves`.
    - `IPermissionEvaluationContext.sandboxAutoApproved`.
    - The `commandSandbox` session option.
    - The `sandbox` settings key and the `sandbox` command host adapter.

### Patch Changes

- 2345c0b: `Glob` and `Grep` now bound file collection to a fixed candidate ceiling before materializing more
  matches, instead of enumerating and `stat`-ing an entire search tree before any `limit`/`headLimit`
  had a chance to apply. `Glob` streams `fast-glob` matches instead of resolving its full-match
  promise form, and `Grep`'s directory walk stops once it has visited the ceiling's worth of entries.
  Both tools state the truncation explicitly in their output when the ceiling is hit — `Glob`'s result
  ordering (by modification time) then applies only to the candidates collected before the ceiling,
  not to the full match set.
- 118fe0e: Bound Edit file input before materializing content, including when file size metadata is stale, and reject a replaceAll whose output would exceed the same ceiling before writing.
- 240777e: Bound Grep file reads before materializing content, including when file size metadata is stale or a file grows during a search.
- 718bdf5: Run builtin Grep regex matching in preemptible isolation with bounded input, output, and execution time.
- 61db70f: Bound host Read input and formatted output bytes before a workflow can materialize an oversized file or result. Oversized reads now fail the tool call instead of returning content.
- db80aba: CLI-042: parallelize the Grep built-in tool's per-file content scan with bounded
  concurrency (`p-limit(50)`), following the glob-tool precedent. Results are still
  collected in file-enumeration order, so output is byte-identical to the previous
  sequential implementation (verified against a pre-change golden on a 1,201-file
  corpus); `headLimit` truncation and binary/unreadable-file skipping are unchanged.
- 4f3c075: Assemble complete, verified package generations before switching build output; preserve the previous generation on build failure and pack only verified regular-file images. Include copied CLI web assets in affected-build ordering and artifact transfer. Preserve the CLI version in managed build paths. Public runtime contracts remain compatible (patch).
- b6d14ce: Make the universal JSON-schema subset able to express an object, so a nested `z.object()` keeps its
  properties and required fields instead of reaching the model as `{ "type": "object" }`. Tools and
  structured-output schemas with one level of nesting are now advertised in full and enforced on the
  tool-input path; `z.union` / `z.discriminatedUnion` / `z.literal` are supported and map to `anyOf`
  and single-value enums; `.nullable()` keeps its null branch; and Zod's `strip`, `strict` and
  `passthrough` modes stop collapsing into two `additionalProperties` emissions. Fixes the shipped
  `Computer` and `AskUserQuestion` built-ins, whose action and question fields were being dropped
  entirely.

  `agent-core` is **minor**, not patch: `IObjectParameterSchema` is a new export, and
  `IParameterSchema.type` became optional (a union node carries `anyOf` instead of a type), which is a
  consumer-visible type change — two call sites in this repo needed editing to keep compiling.
  `additionalProperties` also widened to `boolean | IParameterSchema`, and `required` and `anyOf` are
  new members. The provider packages are **patch**: each adapts to the widened subset without changing
  its own public surface.

- 07b627f: A local peer can now be answered, and what its turn may do depends on where it runs.

  - `agent-core`: the permission evaluator takes a peer turn's authority as one more input
    (`IPermissionEvaluationContext.peerTurn`), decided after the deny list and ceiling and before
    bypass and allow rules. A peer on another host uses no tool. A peer on the same host may use an
    inspect-class tool that declares `workspacePaths`, only when every named location resolves inside
    the workspace and is not a credential (`isSecretPath`); write and execute tools are refused unless
    enabled, and then every use asks. A tool declaring `repliesToPeer` exists only in a peer turn and
    asks once the turn used another tool. New: `isToolAvailableInPeerTurn`, `TPeerReach`,
    `IPeerTurnAuthority`. `IRunOptions.withholdHostedTools` leaves a provider's hosted tools out of a
    run's requests (`nativeWebTools` with `false` withholds a hosted tool for one call).
  - `agent-tools`: `Read` and `Glob` declare the arguments that say where they look. `Grep` does not:
    it reads files it was never named, so a peer turn does not get it.
  - `agent-session`: `ISessionRunOptions.peerReach` makes a run a peer turn for the permission policy;
    every ask in it needs a fresh approval, and its requests carry no provider-hosted tool. `ISessionOptions.allowPeerChanges` enables write and execute
    tools for same-host peer turns.
  - `agent-interface-session`: `ISubmitOptions.peer` (`IPeerTurnContext`) carries a peer turn's reach,
    the message it answers and the session a reply goes to.
  - `agent-interface-session-mobility`: `IPeerMessage.inReplyTo` threads a conversation;
    `peerReachOf(admission)` maps admission to a reach.
  - `agent-framework`: a peer turn is offered what its origin allows, and a new `peer_reply` tool
    answers the peer that sent the message, threaded to it. The setting `peers.allowChanges` enables
    write and execute tools for same-host peer turns.
  - `agent-ui-terminal`: a permission prompt in a peer turn names the requesting peer.
  - `agent-cli`: incoming peer turns carry their reach and reply route; a conversation is limited in
    depth and in how often this session answers it, and a reply over a limit is not sent and the
    operator is told.
  - `agent-provider-anthropic`, `agent-provider-openai-compatible` (Qwen): a request whose
    `nativeWebTools` sets a hosted tool to `false` is sent without it.

- 833afe1: Remove the remaining polynomial-ReDoS backtracking (SEC-003, CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos`) and stop the DTLS fingerprint binding to SDP free text.

  **`extractDtlsFingerprint` (agent-remote-pairing) — remote-reachable, pre-authentication.** Unlike the rest of this class, the SDP it parses arrives over the signaling relay, which the pairing design treats as untrusted, and it is parsed _before_ the channel-binding confirmation — on the browser peer, before `setRemoteDescription` too. Unanchored, `a=fingerprint:\S+\s+…` restarted from every offset in a non-space run: 5.0 s on a 400 KB SDP. It is now anchored to the start of an SDP line (`/^…/m`), which is linear and also stops the extractor from returning a value smuggled into another line's free text (`s=`, `i=`, an unrelated attribute) — text no DTLS stack reads, and which a relay controls. **Behaviour change:** a mid-line `a=fingerprint:` is no longer recognised. Every SDP a WebRTC stack emits puts the attribute at the start of its own line, so no real SDP is affected. A session-level line can still shadow a media-level one; that residual is recorded in the SEC-003 backlog.

  **Trailing-run trims (agent-framework, agent-cli, agent-tools).** `replace(/-+$/, '')`-shaped regexes have no start anchor, so the engine retried the run from every offset inside it and each retry rescanned to the end — 3.0 s at 100 K characters, ~50 s at 400 K. The memory topic sanitiser, the provider profile-name sanitiser, the model-command tool-name projection, the npm registry URL builder, the git-worktree path-segment sanitiser and the sandbox-root normaliser now use linear index scans (`trimEdgeChars` / `trimTrailingChars` in agent-framework, local helpers elsewhere), proven equivalent to the regexes they replace over every string of the relevant alphabet up to 12 characters.

  **Whitespace-ambiguity parsers (agent-framework).** The skill and agent-definition frontmatter list splitters used `/\s*,\s*/`, whose whitespace run overlapped nothing after it on a failed comma — 12.6 s on a 200 K run. They now split on `','`; the padding was already removed by the `.trim()` that follows, so the parsed lists are unchanged. The `.git` `gitdir:` pointer and the task-file open-item matcher used `\s*(.+)$` / `\s+(.+)$`, where `\s` and `.` both match a space; the capture is now pinned to start non-space, which accepts exactly the same inputs (verified exhaustively) and removes 14.5 s and 15.4 s worst cases.

  **`WebFetch` HTML-to-text (agent-tools) — carried no CodeQL alert.** Found by sweeping for the same shapes rather than the flagged lines, and the only quadratic here whose input is a live response body from an arbitrary URL. `<[^>]+>`, `<script[\s\S]*?</script>` and `<style…>` each restarted from every opener that had no terminator: 12.6 s on 200 KB of `<`, and the 5 MB the fetch allows would have taken hours. All three are now single-pass scans, verified character-for-character identical to the regexes over ~800 K generated inputs.

  Apart from the `extractDtlsFingerprint` anchoring noted above, no behaviour changes: every fix accepts the same inputs and produces the same values, and each ships an equivalence test pinning that.
