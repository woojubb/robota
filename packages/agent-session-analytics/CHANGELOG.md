## 3.0.0-beta.84

### Patch Changes

- 9c6a8db: A personal usage aggregate's `costStatus` no longer reads as `'unknown'` just because one observation
  in it couldn't be priced (a legacy row, an unknown model, an unpriced advisor call) — it now falls back
  to `'unknown'` only when nothing in the aggregate could be priced at all, so `costUsd` and `costStatus`
  agree with each other. The new `unpricedTurns` field counts the turns excluded from `costUsd` for this
  reason, present only when that count is above zero.

  The personal usage report also gained `sessionFirstSeen`, an ISO timestamp per session id of its
  earliest observation or activity in the report — content-free, like the rest of the report — so a GUI
  can label a session outside its own local listing by date instead of a raw id.

### Patch Changes

- 3c81769: A supervised session accepts attach connections on its control socket.

  - A terminal of the same user sends `{"command":"attach","id","generation","mode":"drive"|"observe","protocol":1}`.
    The session compares the generation with its own. It refuses another generation, an unknown mode or
    protocol, or a fifth concurrent attach. Otherwise it answers `{"status":"attached","driverId":"attach:<n>"}`
    and carries the ordinary session protocol as newline-delimited JSON on the same connection.
  - The driver id is assigned by the session and a client-sent one is ignored. Turns submitted from an
    attached terminal are attributed to it and counted under the new `attach` usage surface.
  - `drive` sends prompts and answers the session's questions under the usual co-drive rules. `observe`
    is read-only and never counts as a surface that can answer, so an unattended session still denies
    its prompts at once.
  - Detaching or crashing ends only that connection: a turn in progress keeps running, a prompt no other
    surface can answer is denied, and the session returns to its unattached posture. A reader that falls
    1 MiB behind is disconnected, and an oversize frame closes only its own connection. Stopping the
    session ends attached connections with it.
  - Commands from an attached terminal carry the remote origin, so pairing, revoking and reading the
    pairing link stay refused. An attached terminal is never an operator approver; supervised sessions
    keep refusing mesh connections that need one.
  - A client may send its first frames in the same write as the handshake; only the handshake line
    itself is held to the control endpoint's line limit.
  - `agent-framework`: the surface a turn was submitted on now reaches its usage observation. It was
    dropped before, so remote-control turns were counted as `unknown`.
  - The terminal client (`__PRODUCT_CLI_NAME__ session attach`) and the view keys come separately.

- 57280bf: Every published package now declares `"engines": { "node": ">=22.12.0" }`. Before, 27 of the 38
  packages declared no floor (`agent-core`, `agent-tools` and every provider among them),
  `agent-session` and `agent-file-authority` declared `>=20.19.0`, and the other nine declared
  `>=22.0.0`, so a consumer on Node 20 saw at most a warning from a transitive dependency.

  Why 22.12: `agent-cli` and `agent-ui-terminal` need Node 22 through `ink` 7, and the CommonJS entries
  of `agent-tools` and its dependents, `agent-transport`/`node` and its dependents, and
  `agent-ui-terminal` `require()` ESM-only dependencies (`p-limit`, `jose`, `chalk`), which Node 22
  supports unflagged only from 22.12. `engines` is advisory unless the consumer enables `engine-strict`.

  No code changes: `tsdown` now reads `node22.12.0` as its build target from the field.

- 18c0d5c: Every published package now exports `./package.json`, so `require('<package>/package.json')` and
  `import('<package>/package.json', { with: { type: 'json' } })` work instead of failing with
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, and each tarball now ships the package's `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 3.0.0-beta.80

### Minor Changes

- 4078a72: Model fallback chain. `--fallback-model a,b` (or the `fallbackModel` settings array; the flag wins) names up to three models a turn moves to when its model is overloaded, unavailable or failing on the server. An entry is a provider profile, `profile:model`, a bare model on the primary's provider, or `default`. The move happens only before any output has streamed, lasts for the current turn, and is shown as a system note; entries that cannot be built are passed over and entries outside the organization's `allowedProviders` are dropped with a notice. `FallbackProvider` in agent-framework implements it over the session's provider; `IChatOptions` gains `executionId`, `onModelFallback` and `preserveContextWindow`, `IAIProvider` gains optional `resolveModelRoute`, and the execution loop emits a `provider_fallback` event and attributes requests, call observations, committed replies, the response cache and usage to the model that answered. A turn that ran on more than one model records per-model `modelShares` on its usage observation, which personal usage reports split by model and provider. A `/provider` switch keeps the chain, read again for the new primary.

### Patch Changes

- 9368d00: Advisor escalation: the main model can consult a second model at the decision points it chooses.

  With an advisor configured (`--advisor <profile>[:<model>]`, or the `advisorModel` setting that
  `/advisor` saves; the flag wins), the session gets an `Advisor({ question? })` tool. The advisor reads
  the whole conversation — system prompt, messages, tool calls and results — serialized into one prompt
  and sent with `toolChoice: 'none'`, truncated from the front to fit its window with the system prompt
  kept, and declines when even that does not fit. Its answer comes back framed as guidance to verify;
  an empty or refusing answer reads as declined. Calls are limited to two per turn and a fixed number
  per session, parallel calls in one round share those limits, and a repeated question in the same
  turn returns the earlier answer. A request that was sent counts even when the provider failed (the
  decline is reported by class, never by its text); only a call declined before sending gives its slot
  back.

  Advisor usage, including in-process subagents', is recorded where each turn's usage is recorded —
  the persisted session history, under the advisor's own provider and model — so `/cost`, usage reports
  and resumed sessions include it. `/cost` now totals that history and prices each part on its own
  model, showing "mixed" when more than one model was priced.

  `/advisor <model>` and `/advisor off` change only where calls go, never the tool list, so the main
  model's prompt cache is not invalidated mid-session; the tool is added only when a session starts
  with an advisor. Sending history to a destination (provider type and endpoint host) the main model
  does not already use needs a one-time consent per destination, kept in the user settings file; a
  refusal is remembered for the session. The organization's `allowedProviders` applies, and
  `PRODUCT_DISABLE_ADVISOR=1` turns it off completely. In-process subagents inherit the advisor, bound
  to their own conversation; child-process subagents do not get it.

  **`@robota-sdk/agent-framework` is `major` for one reason: `ICommandHostSessionAccess` gains a
  required member,** `getSessionUsage()`, the session's persisted usage records. An external
  implementation of that role port stops compiling until it adds the method. The rest is additive.

  - `agent-session` — `formatConversationEntries`, the one text rendering of a conversation, now used
    by compaction too. It keeps tool calls and results, marks a user message a peer session sent
    (`user [from "peer:<id>"]`), and JSON-encodes every message onto one line so no content can forge
    another entry; compaction previously flattened all of this. `Session.getProvider()` returns the
    provider the session currently uses.
  - `agent-framework` — `AdvisorController`, `createAdvisorTool`, the advisor spec helpers, provider
    destinations (`describeProviderDestination`, `rememberProviderDestination`), `getSessionUsage` and
    `ISessionUsageRecord`, the `onUsageRecorded` session option, and the optional `advisor` command
    host adapter. Session assembly binds a host-supplied Advisor tool to the session holding it.
  - `agent-command` — the `/advisor` command module; `/cost` reads the session's persisted usage.
  - `agent-cli` — the `--advisor` flag, `advisorModel` setting, per-destination consent store and kill
    switch.
  - `agent-ui-terminal` — a usage line from another source (the advisor, a background task) names that
    source and leaves out the context window it does not have.
  - `agent-session-analytics` — personal usage counts an advisor call's tokens and cost toward its
    turn without counting it as a turn.

- 4f3c075: Assemble complete, verified package generations before switching build output; preserve the previous generation on build failure and pack only verified regular-file images. Include copied CLI web assets in affected-build ordering and artifact transfer. Preserve the CLI version in managed build paths. Public runtime contracts remain compatible (patch).

### Minor Changes

- c0a6287: Relocate session feature logic out of the CLI shell and the transport (DQ-AUDIT-004):

  - Extract session-log timing analysis into the new `@robota-sdk/agent-session-analytics` package (pure analysis over canonical session records — no duplicate types, no file I/O). `agent-cli`'s `session analyze` command shrinks to thin wiring and loads records via the new `createUserSessionStore()` / existing `createProjectSessionStore()` framework facades.
  - Move LLM-based session auto-naming (`generateSessionName`) from `agent-transport/tui` into `agent-framework` (session-lifecycle owner); the TUI transport now invokes it through the framework.
