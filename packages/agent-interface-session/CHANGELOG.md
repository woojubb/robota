## 3.0.0-beta.81

### Minor Changes

- 3038eb7: A message from another session is instant messaging: text from an untrusted third party that
  carries no authority. What the model does with it is decided by the session's ordinary permissions —
  rules, permission mode and remembered consent — exactly like the session's own work. The per-origin
  peer policy is gone.

  **BREAKING**

  - `agent-core`: `IPermissionEvaluationContext.peerTurn` is now a boolean. It decides only whether a
    `repliesToPeer` tool exists; every other call in a peer turn is decided as in any turn. Removed:
    `isToolAvailableInPeerTurn`, `isSecretPath`, `IPeerTurnAuthority`, `TPeerReach` (now exported by
    `agent-interface-session-mobility`) and `IToolPermissionProfile.workspacePaths`.
  - `agent-tools`: `Read` and `Glob` no longer declare `workspacePaths`.
  - `agent-session`: `ISessionRunOptions.peerReach` is replaced by `peerTurn?: boolean`, and
    `ISessionOptions.allowPeerChanges` is removed. An ask in a peer turn is answered like any other:
    a consent the operator remembered answers it, and an "always allow" given there is remembered.
  - `agent-interface-session`: `IPeerTurnContext` no longer has `reach`; it carries only the reply
    route.
  - `agent-interface-session-mobility`: `peerReachOf` is removed; `TPeerReach` moves here. A delegated
    turn carries no reach.
  - `agent-framework`: the `peers.allowChanges` setting is removed (an existing value is ignored). A
    peer turn is offered the ordinary tools, plus `peer_reply`.

  **Changes**

  - `agent-framework`: the per-turn statement tells the model the message is an opinion from an
    untrusted third party, not its owner's instruction, and that it decides for itself whether and how
    to act. A message still expands no `@path` and attaches no context reference, and its requests
    still carry no provider-hosted tool, since no permission step can decide one. The session takes
    at most 6 messages a minute and 30 an hour from each sender for a turn; a message over the limit
    is refused with a reason the sender receives. A prompt answer given in the name of a `peer:` or `external:`
    driver is ignored. External-event turns keep their tool-less baseline.
  - `agent-cli`: incoming peer turns carry only their reply route.

## 3.0.0-beta.80

### Minor Changes

- 37b4bd7: `readAssistantReplies`, `readErrors`, `readLastAssistantText` and `readToolCalls` are exported from
  `@robota-sdk/agent-interface-session`, which is now published alongside
  `@robota-sdk/agent-interface-transport` (issue #2260).

  The four helpers shipped from `agent-interface-transport@3.0.0-beta.79` and moved to the session
  package on `develop` (ARCH-103..108), which was not yet on the registry. A consumer importing them
  from the transport package migrates the import to `@robota-sdk/agent-interface-session`; the session
  package is in the changeset fixed group, so it versions and publishes with the transport package.

### Patch Changes

- 4f3c075: Assemble complete, verified package generations before switching build output; preserve the previous generation on build failure and pack only verified regular-file images. Include copied CLI web assets in affected-build ordering and artifact transfer. Preserve the CLI version in managed build paths. Public runtime contracts remain compatible (patch).
- 07b627f: A local peer can now be answered, and what its turn may do depends on where it runs.

  - `agent-core`: the permission evaluator takes a peer turn's authority as one more input
    (`IPermissionEvaluationContext.peerTurn`), decided after the deny list and ceiling and before
    bypass and allow rules. A peer on another host uses no tool. A peer on the same host may use an
    inspect-class tool that declares `workspacePaths`, only when every named location resolves inside
    the workspace and is not a credential (`isSecretPath`); write and execute tools are refused unless
    enabled, and then every use asks. A tool declaring `repliesToPeer` exists only in a peer turn and
    asks once the turn used another tool. New: `isToolAvailableInPeerTurn`, `TPeerReach`,
    `IPeerTurnAuthority`. `IRunOptions.withholdHostedTools` leaves a provider's hosted tools out of a
    run's requests (`nativeWebTools` with `false` withholds a hosted tool for one call).
  - `agent-tools`: `Read` and `Glob` declare the arguments that say where they look. `Grep` does not:
    it reads files it was never named, so a peer turn does not get it.
  - `agent-session`: `ISessionRunOptions.peerReach` makes a run a peer turn for the permission policy;
    every ask in it needs a fresh approval, and its requests carry no provider-hosted tool. `ISessionOptions.allowPeerChanges` enables write and execute
    tools for same-host peer turns.
  - `agent-interface-session`: `ISubmitOptions.peer` (`IPeerTurnContext`) carries a peer turn's reach,
    the message it answers and the session a reply goes to.
  - `agent-interface-session-mobility`: `IPeerMessage.inReplyTo` threads a conversation;
    `peerReachOf(admission)` maps admission to a reach.
  - `agent-framework`: a peer turn is offered what its origin allows, and a new `peer_reply` tool
    answers the peer that sent the message, threaded to it. The setting `peers.allowChanges` enables
    write and execute tools for same-host peer turns.
  - `agent-ui-terminal`: a permission prompt in a peer turn names the requesting peer.
  - `agent-cli`: incoming peer turns carry their reach and reply route; a conversation is limited in
    depth and in how often this session answers it, and a reply over a limit is not sent and the
    operator is told.
  - `agent-provider-anthropic`, `agent-provider-openai-compatible` (Qwen): a request whose
    `nativeWebTools` sets a hosted tool to `false` is sent without it.
