## 3.0.0-beta.84

### Minor Changes

- e8d70ac: A first run finds a provider, instead of a dead end. `robota --serve` (and the daemon it starts) no
  longer refuses when no provider is configured: it starts in setup mode, and the GUI's conversation area
  shows a "Connect a model provider to start" panel with a "Set up provider" button in place of the
  composer. Answering it configures and swaps in the first provider live, with no restart. A startup
  failure now says why — `robota daemon start --json` and the desktop app's fatal screen report the
  child's own reason instead of a generic "readiness channel closed", and the fatal screen gets a Try
  again button. `trust status --json` and the desktop trust dialog list only sources whose state trust
  would actually change, instead of naming one this platform could not determine; the dialog shows one
  sentence and a collapsed Details section. `robota --serve --open` in an untrusted folder now asks at
  the terminal (trust it, start Restricted, or quit) when someone is there to ask, instead of refusing
  outright.

## 3.0.0-beta.83

### Major Changes

- 7b72344: Every client can offer the session's commands and skills and show its status. The GUI uses them as a
  desktop-style composer.

  - `agent-interface-session` is **`major` because `IInteractiveSession` gains required members**:
    `ISessionCommands.listSkills()` and a `statusRead` capability, `getStatusSnapshot()`. The snapshot
    holds session, model, permission mode, effort, context and goal. An external implementation stops
    compiling until it adds both.
  - `agent-transport` is **`major` for the same reason on `IProtocolSession`**. It also gains the wire
    messages `get-commands` → `commands` and `get-status` → `session_status`. Both are reads that the
    observe role may send.
  - `agent-interface-command` gains `ICommandSkillListEntry`, moved from `agent-framework`, which
    re-exports it unchanged.
  - `agent-ui-web` is **`major` because its state changes shape**:
    - A command's outcome and a finished turn's tool calls are now conversation entries: `messages` is
      `TConversationEntry[]`.
    - The `uiIntentNotices` list, `dismissUiIntentNotice`, `applyUiIntentEvent`,
      `removeUiIntentNotice` and `IUiIntentNotice` are removed. An intent now answers with an info
      line in the conversation.
    - Session notices keep only `session-error` and `protocol-error`.
    - The state gains `commandCatalog` and `sessionStatus`.
  - `agent-command` registers `/theme` and `/keybindings` even without a terminal. They then answer
    that they belong to the robota terminal, instead of being unknown.
  - `agent-framework`:
    - `InteractiveSession.getStatusSnapshot()`.
    - The main-thread row previews the last chat message instead of the last record's type.
  - `agent-cli` serves the full GUI web app, renamed from `agent-cli-web` to `agent-gui-web`, on
    `robota --serve --open`.

- 6ae3f28: A served runtime can list its workspace's sessions, start a new one and switch to another without the
  process or any client connection restarting. The GUI shows them in a sessions sidebar.

  - `agent-interface-session` is **`major`** for two reasons:
    - It adds `ISessionListing`, `ISessionDirectory` and `ISessionSwitchedEvent`.
    - `IInteractiveSessionEvents` gains a required `session_switched` event. An exhaustive map over the
      event names stops compiling until it classifies the new event.
  - `agent-transport` is **`major`** for the same kind of reason:
    - It adds the wire messages `list-sessions` → `sessions`/`sessions_error`, `new-session`,
      `switch-session`, and the broadcast `session_switched`.
    - It adds a `sessionDirectory` handler option. A refusal to switch comes back as a
      `protocol_error` carrying the reason.
    - An exhaustive map over message types must add the new variants.
  - `agent-transport-ws` passes a configured `sessionDirectory` to every connection.
  - `agent-framework` is **`major` because `IRuntimeHostHandle.session` is now a `SessionSlot`**, not the
    `InteractiveSession`, and `bindTransports` receives the slot.
    - The slot is an `IInteractiveSession` that forwards to the current session. Members outside that
      interface are read through `host.session.current`, which changes on a switch.
    - Adds `InteractiveSession.whenInitialized()`.
    - Exports `listUnreadableSessions`.
  - `agent-ui-web` is **`major`**:
    - `IWsSessionState` gains session listing state and actions.
    - It adds a `SessionSidebar`.
    - `/resume` opens the sidebar.
  - `agent-cli`: `robota --serve` provides the session directory, and refuses a switch that would lose
    work in progress. External-event grants belong to the run: a switch reopens them on the new session,
    as the TUI already does.
  - External-event grant history (spent tokens, rate windows, revocations) belongs to the run. The new
    option `externalEventGrantHistory` (from `createExternalEventGrantHistory()`) is shared by every
    session that a served runtime or the TUI builds. A session switch therefore replays no spent token
    and resets no rate limit. The TUI previously had this gap when it switched sessions.

- ba822c1: An attached client reads a workspace entry's detail, stops a waiting self-paced loop, completes
  subcommands, and sees status changes another client made.

  - `agent-interface-session` (major): `IInteractiveSession` gains the required roles
    `ISessionExecutionDetail` and `ISessionSelfPacedLoopControl` (`TWaitingLoopStopOutcome`), and the
    exhaustively mapped event map gains `status_changed`.
  - `agent-transport` (major): `IProtocolSession` gains both roles; the wire unions gain
    `read-execution-detail`, `stop-waiting-loop`, `execution_detail`, `execution_detail_error` and
    `waiting_loop_stop`; `status_changed` is pushed as `session_status`; `isObserverMessageType` is
    exported from the root and `./client`.
  - `agent-interface-command` (minor): `ICommandListEntry` gains optional `argumentHint` and
    `subcommands` (`ICommandSubcommandEntry`).
  - `agent-cli` (minor):
    - `robota session attach` and an attach from `robota session view` open the full terminal UI,
      the one `robota --attach` opens, in drive mode or, with `--observe`, read-only. The reduced
      attached view is gone.
    - A served runtime names each of its sessions after the session's first real turn.
  - `agent-framework` (minor):
    - `InteractiveSession` gains `stopWaitingSelfPacedLoop(reason?)`: it stops the one waiting loop,
      or stops none and names `/loop stop` when several wait. `SessionSlot` forwards it and
      `readExecutionWorkspaceDetail`.
    - The session emits `status_changed` when its mode, model, effort, goal or name changes, after a
      command, a turn, a rename or a goal or plan transition.
    - A new option `autoName: true` makes the session name itself once, after its first turn, with its
      current provider; it keeps a name it already has and lets a rename made meanwhile win. Off by
      default.
    - The command catalog carries each command's `argumentHint` and `subcommands`.
  - `agent-ui-terminal` (major):
    - The full terminal UI attached to a host's session reads a workspace entry's detail, sends input
      to a background task, stops a waiting self-paced loop on Esc, and completes subcommands.
    - `renderAttachedApp` takes `mode: 'drive' | 'observe'` (default `'drive'`) and `announce`. In
      observe mode the terminal sends only what an observer may send, refuses prompts, host commands,
      abort and loop stop with a read-only notice, still runs `/exit` and its own commands, and its
      status bar says it is observing. `ITuiChannelSnapshot` gains `readOnly`.
    - The in-process terminal no longer names sessions; it builds its session with `autoName: true`.
      `ITuiInteractionChannelOptions.onAutoNamed` is removed.

- 6e6b06b: A wire client can now render the whole session the way the in-process terminal UI does: the full
  history, the context window as it changes, when the history changes, and where each turn came from.

  - `agent-interface-session` is **`major`**: `ISessionConversationRead` gains a required
    `getFullHistory()`. Any implementation of it, or of `IInteractiveSession`, must add it.
  - `agent-transport` is **`major`**:
    - It adds `get-history { fromIndex? }` → `history { startIndex, total, entries }`. The history
      crosses one bounded page at a time (at most 256 KiB of entries; a single larger entry is sent
      alone), from `fromIndex` (default 0), so no reply grows with the session. The client asks for
      the next page after the previous one arrived. Entries are `IWireHistoryEntry`: a history entry
      with an ISO 8601 `timestamp`. An observer may send it.
    - `complete` and `interrupted` carry the turn's result without the session's history
      (`TWireExecutionResult`); a client reads the history with `get-history`.
    - It adds `get-prompts`: the host sends the permission and ask prompts still open as the
      `permission_request` / `ask_request` frames that asked them, for a client that attached later.
      An observer may not send it.
    - `pending` gains an optional `pendingCount`: a host sends it when it knows how many prompts are
      queued, and a client that gets none counts the prompt it shows. The host sends `pending` in
      reply to a `submit` once it has taken the prompt, so a prompt queued behind a running turn shows
      as queued.
    - `command` takes an optional `requestId`, which the host echoes on the command's
      `command_result` or `protocol_error`.
    - The session's `context_update` is pushed as the `context` frame that `get-context` answers with.
    - `compact`, `skill_activation` and `memory_event` push the new `history_changed`; the client
      reads the history again.
    - `turn_source` is pushed as the new `turn_source` frame.
    - An exhaustive map over `TClientMessage` or `TServerMessage` types must add the new variants,
      and `IProtocolSession` now requires `getFullHistory()`.
  - `agent-transport-http` is **`major`** only because `IHttpTransportSession` includes the conversation
    read role, so a session handed to it must now provide `getFullHistory()`.
  - `agent-framework`: `SessionSlot` forwards `getFullHistory()` to the current session.
  - `agent-ui-web` receives the new frames and does not render them.

### Minor Changes

- 57f57f5: A daemon keeps several sessions live, and each client is bound to its own: one client's switch moves
  only that client.

  - `agent-interface-session`: `ISessionBinder`/`ISessionBinding`, the session-change refusal codes with
    `isSessionChangeRefusal`, and listing rows that may say `live` and `clients`.
  - `agent-framework`: `SessionPool` and `SessionChangeRefusal`.
  - `agent-transport` (**major**): a new server frame, `session_change_failed`, which an exhaustive
    consumer must handle. A refused `new-session` or `switch-session` now answers with it, carrying a
    `code`, instead of `protocol_error`; both requests take an optional `requestId` that it echoes.
  - `agent-transport-ws`: the `sessionBinder` option binds each connection to its own session and
    releases the binding when the connection closes.
  - `agent-cli`: `robota --serve` and the daemon keep up to four sessions live. Each WebSocket client and
    attached terminal is bound to its own session; leaving a busy session is no longer refused, and only
    the last driver of a session with a pending prompt is kept from leaving it. Grants and the supervised
    name stay on the runtime's first session, and its reported activity covers every live session.
  - `agent-ui-web`: a refused new or switch shows the host's reason as a notice (an older host's
    `protocol_error` still does); the session sidebar marks live sessions and counts the other clients
    on each; after a reconnect to a host that keeps sessions live, the GUI returns to the session it was on.
  - `agent-ui-terminal`: an attached terminal shows why a switch was refused, and the picker's switch
    stays pending until the host answers; the session picker marks live sessions and their clients.

### Patch Changes

- 57280bf: Every published package now declares `"engines": { "node": ">=22.12.0" }`. Before, 27 of the 38
  packages declared no floor (`agent-core`, `agent-tools` and every provider among them),
  `agent-session` and `agent-file-authority` declared `>=20.19.0`, and the other nine declared
  `>=22.0.0`, so a consumer on Node 20 saw at most a warning from a transitive dependency.

  Why 22.12: `agent-cli` and `agent-ui-terminal` need Node 22 through `ink` 7, and the CommonJS entries
  of `agent-tools` and its dependents, `agent-transport`/`node` and its dependents, and
  `agent-ui-terminal` `require()` ESM-only dependencies (`p-limit`, `jose`, `chalk`), which Node 22
  supports unflagged only from 22.12. `engines` is advisory unless the consumer enables `engine-strict`.

  No code changes: `tsdown` now reads `node22.12.0` as its build target from the field.

- 18c0d5c: Every published package now exports `./package.json`, so `require('<package>/package.json')` and
  `import('<package>/package.json', { with: { type: 'json' } })` work instead of failing with
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, and each tarball now ships the package's `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 3.0.0-beta.81

### Minor Changes

- 3038eb7: A message from another session is instant messaging: text from an untrusted third party that
  carries no authority. What the model does with it is decided by the session's ordinary permissions —
  rules, permission mode and remembered consent — exactly like the session's own work. The per-origin
  peer policy is gone.

  **BREAKING**

  - `agent-core`: `IPermissionEvaluationContext.peerTurn` is now a boolean. It decides only whether a
    `repliesToPeer` tool exists; every other call in a peer turn is decided as in any turn. Removed:
    `isToolAvailableInPeerTurn`, `isSecretPath`, `IPeerTurnAuthority`, `TPeerReach` (now exported by
    `agent-interface-session-mobility`) and `IToolPermissionProfile.workspacePaths`.
  - `agent-tools`: `Read` and `Glob` no longer declare `workspacePaths`.
  - `agent-session`: `ISessionRunOptions.peerReach` is replaced by `peerTurn?: boolean`, and
    `ISessionOptions.allowPeerChanges` is removed. An ask in a peer turn is answered like any other:
    a consent the operator remembered answers it, and an "always allow" given there is remembered.
  - `agent-interface-session`: `IPeerTurnContext` no longer has `reach`; it carries only the reply
    route.
  - `agent-interface-session-mobility`: `peerReachOf` is removed; `TPeerReach` moves here. A delegated
    turn carries no reach.
  - `agent-framework`: the `peers.allowChanges` setting is removed (an existing value is ignored). A
    peer turn is offered the ordinary tools, plus `peer_reply`.

  **Changes**

  - `agent-framework`: the per-turn statement tells the model the message is an opinion from an
    untrusted third party, not its owner's instruction, and that it decides for itself whether and how
    to act. A message still expands no `@path` and attaches no context reference, and its requests
    still carry no provider-hosted tool, since no permission step can decide one. The session takes
    at most 6 messages a minute and 30 an hour from each sender for a turn; a message over the limit
    is refused with a reason the sender receives. A prompt answer given in the name of a `peer:` or `external:`
    driver is ignored. External-event turns keep their tool-less baseline.
  - `agent-cli`: incoming peer turns carry only their reply route.

## 3.0.0-beta.80

### Minor Changes

- 37b4bd7: `readAssistantReplies`, `readErrors`, `readLastAssistantText` and `readToolCalls` are exported from
  `@robota-sdk/agent-interface-session`, which is now published alongside
  `@robota-sdk/agent-interface-transport` (issue #2260).

  The four helpers shipped from `agent-interface-transport@3.0.0-beta.79` and moved to the session
  package on `develop` (ARCH-103..108), which was not yet on the registry. A consumer importing them
  from the transport package migrates the import to `@robota-sdk/agent-interface-session`; the session
  package is in the changeset fixed group, so it versions and publishes with the transport package.

### Patch Changes

- 4f3c075: Assemble complete, verified package generations before switching build output; preserve the previous generation on build failure and pack only verified regular-file images. Include copied CLI web assets in affected-build ordering and artifact transfer. Preserve the CLI version in managed build paths. Public runtime contracts remain compatible (patch).
- 07b627f: A local peer can now be answered, and what its turn may do depends on where it runs.

  - `agent-core`: the permission evaluator takes a peer turn's authority as one more input
    (`IPermissionEvaluationContext.peerTurn`), decided after the deny list and ceiling and before
    bypass and allow rules. A peer on another host uses no tool. A peer on the same host may use an
    inspect-class tool that declares `workspacePaths`, only when every named location resolves inside
    the workspace and is not a credential (`isSecretPath`); write and execute tools are refused unless
    enabled, and then every use asks. A tool declaring `repliesToPeer` exists only in a peer turn and
    asks once the turn used another tool. New: `isToolAvailableInPeerTurn`, `TPeerReach`,
    `IPeerTurnAuthority`. `IRunOptions.withholdHostedTools` leaves a provider's hosted tools out of a
    run's requests (`nativeWebTools` with `false` withholds a hosted tool for one call).
  - `agent-tools`: `Read` and `Glob` declare the arguments that say where they look. `Grep` does not:
    it reads files it was never named, so a peer turn does not get it.
  - `agent-session`: `ISessionRunOptions.peerReach` makes a run a peer turn for the permission policy;
    every ask in it needs a fresh approval, and its requests carry no provider-hosted tool. `ISessionOptions.allowPeerChanges` enables write and execute
    tools for same-host peer turns.
  - `agent-interface-session`: `ISubmitOptions.peer` (`IPeerTurnContext`) carries a peer turn's reach,
    the message it answers and the session a reply goes to.
  - `agent-interface-session-mobility`: `IPeerMessage.inReplyTo` threads a conversation;
    `peerReachOf(admission)` maps admission to a reach.
  - `agent-framework`: a peer turn is offered what its origin allows, and a new `peer_reply` tool
    answers the peer that sent the message, threaded to it. The setting `peers.allowChanges` enables
    write and execute tools for same-host peer turns.
  - `agent-ui-terminal`: a permission prompt in a peer turn names the requesting peer.
  - `agent-cli`: incoming peer turns carry their reach and reply route; a conversation is limited in
    depth and in how often this session answers it, and a reply over a limit is not sent and the
    operator is told.
  - `agent-provider-anthropic`, `agent-provider-openai-compatible` (Qwen): a request whose
    `nativeWebTools` sets a hosted tool to `false` is sent without it.
