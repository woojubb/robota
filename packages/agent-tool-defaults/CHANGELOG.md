## 3.0.0-beta.84

### Patch Changes

- c7f213c: `createDefaultTools` returned the same `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` tool instances on every call — the
  two module-level singletons `@robota-sdk/agent-tools` exports — unlike every other tool in the set,
  which was already built fresh per call. Two sessions built from separate `createDefaultTools({cwd})`
  calls that were open at the same time shared those two tools without meaning to, which a resource
  guard keyed by object identity (as `@robota-sdk/agent-roundtable-robota`'s does) rejected as reused
  even though nothing about either tool needs to be shared across sessions. `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` are
  now built per call, the same way `Glob`/`Grep` already were.

## 3.0.0-beta.83

### Patch Changes

- 57280bf: Every published package now declares `"engines": { "node": ">=22.12.0" }`. Before, 27 of the 38
  packages declared no floor (`agent-core`, `agent-tools` and every provider among them),
  `agent-session` and `agent-file-authority` declared `>=20.19.0`, and the other nine declared
  `>=22.0.0`, so a consumer on Node 20 saw at most a warning from a transitive dependency.

  Why 22.12: `agent-cli` and `agent-ui-terminal` need Node 22 through `ink` 7, and the CommonJS entries
  of `agent-tools` and its dependents, `agent-transport`/`node` and its dependents, and
  `agent-ui-terminal` `require()` ESM-only dependencies (`p-limit`, `jose`, `chalk`), which Node 22
  supports unflagged only from 22.12. `engines` is advisory unless the consumer enables `engine-strict`.

  No code changes: `tsdown` now reads `node22.12.0` as its build target from the field.

- 18c0d5c: Every published package now exports `./package.json`, so `require('<package>/package.json')` and
  `import('<package>/package.json', { with: { type: 'json' } })` work instead of failing with
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, and each tarball now ships the package's `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Minor Changes

- 267af5f: The execution containment seam states where tools run.

  - **`ISandboxClient.filesystem`** (`'shared' | 'separate'`, absent means `separate`).
    - With a **separate** filesystem (E2B, in-memory), every file tool goes through the sandbox, and
      `Glob`/`Grep`, which can only read the host, are withheld. Previously a remote sandbox still
      offered host-reading search tools beside sandbox-writing edit tools.
    - With a **shared** filesystem (OS-level confinement over the host's files), file tools stay on
      the host under the path guard, and only commands go through the sandbox.
  - **`describeExecutionContainment` / `routesFilesThroughSandbox`** name the containment (`host`,
    `sandbox-shared`, `sandbox-separate`) instead of inferring it from an absent value.
  - **`__PRODUCT_CLI_NAME__ doctor` reports `execution.containment`.** __PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME__ composes no sandbox today, so the
    doctor says shell commands run unconfined on the host and the permission rules are the only
    boundary. The CLI composition and the doctor read the same value.
  - **The `Agent` and `BackgroundProcess` tools no longer fall back to `process.cwd()`** when they
    were built without an execution root. They report an assembly error instead, as the file tools
    already did (ARCH-010).

- 7b85767: ARCH-035 — the default tool set becomes a composition leaf.

  **New package: `@robota-sdk/agent-tool-defaults`.** It owns `createDefaultTools` and
  `ICreateDefaultToolsOptions`, including the adapter gating that adds `CodebaseRetrieval` when a
  `retrievalAdapter` is supplied and the Computer tools when a `computerDriver` is.

  **Breaking for `@robota-sdk/agent-framework`:** `createDefaultTools` and `ICreateDefaultToolsOptions`
  are no longer exported from it. Import them from `@robota-sdk/agent-tool-defaults`. The packages are
  pre-release and this repo keeps no compatibility shims, so they are moved rather than deprecated.

  **Also breaking:** the internal `createSession` assembly factory is now `async`. This does NOT affect
  `IAgentRuntime.createSession`, which stays synchronous — it does not call that factory, and a
  verification scenario now asserts that explicitly, because propagating async through it would break
  every consumer that builds a session without supplying `defaultTools`.

  **Zero-config behaviour is unchanged**, deliberately. `createQuery` and the headless runtime have no
  `defaultTools` seam, so a session built without one still receives the built-in tool tier —
  `agent-framework` reaches the new leaf through a dynamic `import()`. An earlier revision of this work
  proposed deleting the tier outright and was rejected on measurement: two published surfaces cannot
  express the alternative, and the failure mode was a silently toolless agent behind a green typecheck.

  **Why the move matters.** `agent-subagent-runner` legitimately depends on `agent-framework`, so while
  the aggregator sat on that barrel a neutral runner could compose the product's tool surface with only
  a scan in the way. It has no manifest edge to the new leaf, so that import does not resolve there at
  all — the guarantee is carried by the type system now, mirroring what `@robota-sdk/agent-provider-defaults`
  already does on the provider axis.

  `@robota-sdk/pack-coding` is a patch: it consumes the leaf instead of rebuilding the same list by
  hand. Its contributed tool surface is unchanged — verified from the published tarballs.

### Patch Changes

- 4f3c075: Assemble complete, verified package generations before switching build output; preserve the previous generation on build failure and pack only verified regular-file images. Include copied CLI web assets in affected-build ordering and artifact transfer. Preserve the CLI version in managed build paths. Public runtime contracts remain compatible (patch).
