# robota-docs

## 1.0.13

### Patch Changes

- Major code quality improvements and architectural refactoring:

  - **Facade Pattern Implementation**: Simplified Robota class interface with manager-based architecture (ai, system, functions, analytics, tools, limits, conversation)
  - **Deprecated Methods Removal**: Removed 20+ deprecated methods, replaced with clean option-based constructor
  - **File Modularization**: Split large files into focused modules (function.ts â†’ 4 modules, conversation-history refactoring)
  - **State Management Enhancement**: Implemented state machine pattern for sessions with improved error handling
  - **Pure Function Optimization**: Reduced complexity with pure functions and better separation of concerns
  - **TypeScript Improvements**: Fixed all compilation errors and improved type safety
  - **Example Updates**: Updated examples to use new API patterns

  Breaking changes are minimal as the core functionality remains the same, but the internal architecture is significantly cleaner and more maintainable.
