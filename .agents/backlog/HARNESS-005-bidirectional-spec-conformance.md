# HARNESS-005: Spec-conformance loop must check SPEC→code direction explicitly

## Problem

agent-transport SPEC documented `allowedTools`/`deniedTools` on the TUI render options while the
code (`IRenderOptions`) lacked both fields — the spec was ahead of code and stayed ahead. The
conformance habit only catches code-ahead-of-spec drift.

## Proposed Change

Update the `spec-code-conformance` skill: the verification loop enumerates SPEC-declared fields/
exports/events and confirms each exists in code (SPEC→code), in addition to the existing
code→SPEC direction. Record both directions in conformance evidence.

## Test Plan

- Skill document update reviewed against the CLI-053 case as the worked example.
- Next conformance run on one package records both-direction evidence.

## User Execution Test Scenarios

Not applicable — skill documentation change.
