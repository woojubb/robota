# Code Improvement Checklist - Remaining Tasks

## üìã Overview
Remaining tasks for code quality improvement of each package in the `packages/` folder.

---

## üöÄ Improvement Plan by Priority

### üü¢ Low Priority
1. **i18n System** - Multilingual support
   - Multilingual support for error messages
   - Tool description and parameter description multilingual processing
   - Localized log messages
2. **Documentation** - JSDoc improvements
   - Automatic API documentation generation system
   - Usage examples and tutorial expansion

---

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. **i18n System** - Multilingual support implementation
2. **Documentation** - JSDoc improvements and automatic API documentation generation

---

## üìù Notes

- All improvements should proceed while maintaining existing API compatibility
- Secure refactoring stability by improving test code together
- Maintain system stability through gradual improvements

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### üèóÔ∏è packages/core - Core Package (Completed)

#### üéØ robota.ts (Main Class)
- **Facade Pattern Application**
  - Keep only core methods (run, runStream, close) in Robota class
  - Expose functional managers as readonly properties (ai, system, functions, analytics, tools, limits, conversation)
  - Delegate complex setup methods to each manager
  - Mark existing methods as deprecated for gradual migration support
  - Improved structure to divide files as much as possible

- **Interface Segregation Principle Application**
  - RobotaCore interface: includes only core execution functions (run, runStream, close)
  - RobotaConfigurable interface: includes only configuration-related functions (callTool, getAvailableTools, clearConversationHistory)
  - RobotaComplete interface: integrated interface including all functions
  - Interface separation so clients depend only on necessary functions

- **Class Simplification**
  - Resolved code duplication between `SimpleConversationHistory` and `PersistentSystemConversationHistory`
  - Extracted common logic to `BaseConversationHistory` abstract class
  - Implemented convenience methods in base class to eliminate duplication
  - Simplified each implementation to implement only core functions

### üìö Project-wide Common Improvements (Completed)

#### üìñ TSDoc Comment Optimization (All Classes)
- **Separated detailed examples to separate examples/ folder**
  - All classes in packages/core
  - All classes in packages/tools
  - All classes in packages/sessions
  - All classes in packages/openai, packages/anthropic, packages/google
- **Eliminated duplicate descriptions using @see tags**
  - Added cross-reference links between related classes/methods
  - Removed duplicate descriptions of common concepts
- **Reduced file size by 30-40% keeping only core information (@param, @returns, @throws)**
  - Organized verbose descriptions concisely
  - Kept only essential information and moved additional explanations to examples/

#### Common Structure Unification
- Unified structure of AI Provider packages/openai packages/anthropic packages/google

### üõ†Ô∏è packages/tools - Tool Management (Completed)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è function.ts Refactoring
- **Large File Decomposition**
  - Separated 413-line file by function
  - Separated Zod schema conversion logic to `schema/zod-to-json.ts` module
  - Separated JSON schema conversion logic to `schema/json-to-zod.ts` module
  - Separated Function Registry to `registry/function-registry.ts` class
  - Separated Function creation utilities to `factories/function-factory.ts` module

- **Pure Function Optimization**
  - Decomposed complexity of `zodToJsonSchema()` function into small functions
  - Decomposed type conversion logic into pure functions by type (convertZodString, convertZodNumber, etc.)
  - Optimized recursive calls and improved readability
  - Provided enhanced validation functionality by adding `createValidatedFunction`

- **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - Added dedicated function to format Zod errors
  - Improved argument parsing error handling
  - Improved type safety and provided clear error messages

#### üîß Tool Provider Common Interface Abstraction
- **BaseToolProvider Abstract Class**: Implemented base class integrating common error handling, logging, and tool existence verification logic
- **Structured Error System**: Defined clear error types such as ToolProviderError, ToolNotFoundError, ToolExecutionError
- **Factory Pattern**: Various tool provider creation and management system through ToolProviderFactory
- **Existing Provider Refactoring**: Upgraded ZodFunctionToolProvider, OpenAPIToolProvider, MCPToolProvider to new structure
- **Integrated API**: System that can manage various tool providers with one consistent interface

#### üöÄ Performance Optimization System Implementation (Completed 2024.12.15)
- **Caching System** (`cache-manager.ts`)
  - Implemented `CacheManager` class supporting LRU + TTL algorithms
  - Implemented `FunctionSchemaCacheManager` dedicated to function schemas
  - Cache statistics tracking (hit rate, memory usage) functionality
  - Automatic cache cleanup scheduling system
  - Integrated function schema lazy loading + caching in ZodFunctionToolProvider

- **Lazy Loading System** (`lazy-loader.ts`)
  - Implemented `LazyLoader` class for on-demand resource loading
  - Priority-based preloading system
  - Prevented memory overload with concurrent loading limits
  - Implemented `ToolLazyLoader` dedicated to tool management
  - Loading statistics and performance tracking functionality

- **Resource Management** (`resource-manager.ts`)
  - Implemented `ResourceManager` to prevent memory leaks
  - Automatic resource cleanup based on age and memory usage
  - Periodic memory monitoring and threshold management
  - Graceful shutdown handling during process termination

  - Implemented session state changes with state machine pattern (`state/session-state-machine.ts`)
  - Separated state transition logic into pure functions
  - Safe state management allowing only valid state transitions

- **Error Message Improvements**
  - Separated hardcoded Korean messages into constants (`constants/error-messages.ts`)
  - Applied consistent error handling patterns (SessionOperationError, StateTransitionError)
  - Provided structured error codes and context information

- **Pure Function Utilization**
  - Separated session-related logic into pure functions (`utils/session-utils.ts`)

  - Separated configuration validation and merge logic into reusable functions

- **Enhanced Encapsulation**
  - Hid internal implementation with private methods (_setActiveChat, _deactivateAllChats, etc.)
  - Prevented external changes with readonly properties
  - Clear operation permission checking (_ensureOperationAllowed)
