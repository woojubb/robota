```

## Configuration Files
- **tsconfig.base.json** - Base TypeScript configuration with strict rules
- **.eslintrc.json** - Root ESLint configuration with type safety rules
- Package-specific configs extend the base configuration

## Protected Settings
- TypeScript strict mode settings are immutable
- ESLint type safety rules are error-level and immutable
- Any/unknown type rules cannot be modified

## Development Workflow
- All code must pass strict TypeScript compilation
- Zero tolerance for any/unknown types in production code
- ESLint enforcement at error level for type safety
- Individual package builds: `npm run build` in package directory
- Full workspace build: `npm run build` in root
