# TypeScript Strict Mode: Absolute Any/Unknown Prohibition

## üö® CRITICAL RULE: Zero Tolerance for Any/Unknown Types

### Absolute Prohibition
- **ANY/UNKNOWN types are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** in all code
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** without explicit user consent
- **NO JUSTIFICATIONS** or "reasonable use cases" are allowed
- **NO RATIONALIZATIONS** about "appropriate usage" are permitted

### Required Process for Any/Unknown Usage
1. **MANDATORY**: Ask user verbally before using any/unknown
2. **EXPLICIT CONSENT**: User must explicitly approve each specific usage
3. **DOCUMENTATION**: Record user's explicit approval in code comments
4. **ALTERNATIVE FIRST**: Always propose type-safe alternatives first

### Forbidden Patterns
```typescript
// ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
any
unknown
Record<string, any>
Record<string, unknown>
as any
as unknown
data?: any
params: any
response: unknown
```

### Required Alternatives
```typescript
// ‚úÖ REQUIRED PATTERNS
interface SpecificType { ... }
type UnionType = A | B | C
Generic<T extends ...>
Conditional types: T extends U ? X : Y
Brand types for distinct values
```

### Enforcement Rules
1. **NEVER** find "justifications" for any/unknown usage
2. **NEVER** claim certain usages are "appropriate" or "reasonable"
3. **ALWAYS** propose specific type-safe alternatives
4. **ALWAYS** ask user permission before using any/unknown
5. **IMMEDIATELY** stop and ask if you encounter any/unknown in existing code

### User Consent Protocol
```
Assistant: "I need to use 'any' type for [specific reason]. 
This violates our strict typing rules. 
Do you explicitly approve this specific usage?"

User: Must respond with explicit "Yes, I approve" or similar
```

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Zero any/unknown types without user approval
- [ ] All types are explicitly defined
- [ ] Generic constraints are used where appropriate
- [ ] Union types replace any/unknown
- [ ] Brand types for distinct string/number types
- [ ] Conditional types for complex scenarios

### Remember
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** without user consent
- **NO JUSTIFICATIONS** are acceptable
- **TYPE SAFETY IS ABSOLUTE**
- **USER CONSENT IS MANDATORY**
